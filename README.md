# Movies-ETL
## Purpose
The aim is to creat an automated pipeline on movies and ratings from Wikipedia, Kaggle and MovieLens that takes in new data, performs appropriate transformations and loads data to existing tables. After parsing and cleaning data, the databases will be uploaded to a PostgreSQL Database.
